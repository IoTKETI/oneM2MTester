// Reasoning:
// Field reference on a left hand side of an assignment statement can lead to expansion of
// a matching symbol. If the values of the expanded symbol do not fullfil conditions set by
// template restrictions (after the assignment has been finished), the running test shall
// end with a dynamic error.

// The following requirements are tested:
// (15.6.2.a) When referencing a subfield within a structured field to which AnyValueOrNone 
// or omit is assigned, at the left hand side of an assignment, the structured field is 
// implicitly set to be present, it is expanded recursively up to and including the depth 
// of the referenced subfield. During this expansion an AnyValue shall be assigned to mandatory 
// subfields and AnyValueOrNone shall be assigned to optional subfields. After this expansion 
// the value or matching mechanism at the right hand side of the assignment shall be assigned 
// to the referenced subfield.
//
// (15.8) (omit) the template shall resolve to a value matching mechanism (i.e. the fields 
// of it shall resolve to a specific value or omit, and the whole template may also resolve to 
// omit). Such a template can be used to define a field of a record and set template and the 
// latter one could still be used in a send statement.
