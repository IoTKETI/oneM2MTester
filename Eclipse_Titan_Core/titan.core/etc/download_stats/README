Each time you update the update site:
- Go to the root of the update site
- ./addDownloadStats.sh .

Good to know:
- artifacts.xml.original will be the original artifacts.xml
- New links will be created automatically in /proj/TTCN/www/ttcn/root/download/eclipse_stats for new feature versions (e.g. 2.1.0), timestamp doesn't count
- If a version is removed old links needs to be removed by hand from /proj/TTCN/www/ttcn/root/download/eclipse_stats
- Use etccadmi1 as user tcc-all as group and chmod everything to 664 or 774 etc.
- There's only one PHP script, which simply prints a timestamp on each installation of a given feature
- There're links to this single PHP script for each feature and version
