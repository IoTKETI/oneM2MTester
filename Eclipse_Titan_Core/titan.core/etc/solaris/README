tools for building titan on solaris
(there might not be enough space for a gcc build..)

get.sh    - download source tar.gz of dependencies
build.sh  - build gcc etc on solaris (manually set package versions and paths)
path.sh   - sets the PATH environment (when sourced with . ./path.sh)
titan.sh  - build titan

ip of the solaris machine in the lab:
172.31.21.76

root passwd is the usual
creating user can be with useradd+making home directory

path.sh can be used to set up the PATH for a build because
the binaries and library dependencies are in many different
directories
