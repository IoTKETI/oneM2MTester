// and PStderrBinary ASPs.

// This ASP can only be sent by the test suite: $DIRECTION OUT

// This ASP determines the meaning of the strings representing the standard
// input, output, and error in the ASPs PExecute, PResult, PStdin, PStdout,
// and PStderr.  In the first two ASPs, it determines if a newline is added to
// the end of the inputs and a newline is taken away from the end of the outputs.
// TRUE determines that these changes take place, and FALSE that they do not.
// 
// In the three other ASPs, TRUE means that a newline is added to the end of
// each input string, and that the outputs are sent in separate ASPs each
// containing only one line of text (without the newline).
// 
// By default, the PIPE test port functions as if the PLineMode ASP would have
// been sent with the parameter values TRUE.
// 
// This ASP can only be sent by the test suite: $DIRECTION OUT

// This ASP can only be received by the test suite: $DIRECTION IN
  type record ASP_PError {

// This ASP can be used to notify the test port that the end of input
// is reached. Makes sense for processes started by PExecuteBackground.
// After this ASP is sent to the background process no more input can be sent
// to its stdin using PStdin(Binary)
// Note, that for processes started by PExecute(Binary) the input is
// closed automatically.
