    All MGW Managed Object Classes (MOC) are described with their attributes,

    The MGW MIM is mounted into IS MIM on the IS Blade Systems branch and is
    integrated with IS Common Management Framework (CMF) function.
    Configuration of MGW over IS CMF Netconf interface is then enabled with
    the XML schema as described in the MIM.
    
    Compliance with NETCONF RFC 4741 is described in MGW MIM specification
    (1/155 54-CSA 101 05/3).

    In general the following error handling with Netconf applies to MGW:
    
    1) Non-compliant Netconf operations not supported
    
    2) Create MO cannot be performed (operation-failed) in the following cases:
       - if MO is system created
       - if MO has reference to non-existing MO
       - if mandatory attributes are missing
       - if attribute is of wrong type or value not within range
       
       Delete MO cannot be performed (operation-failed) in the following cases:
       - if MO is system created
       - if MO contains childs and the childs are not system created
       - if MO is referred to from other MO in the model

    3) Any MOC specific error case is described in the MOC description. */

      For bladetype MSP-STM1 and MSP-OC3 there is one TDM interface and for MSP-16E1T1
      there are sixteen TDM interfaces per blade connecting the MGW blade to an outside 
      network, either SDH (MSP-STM1), SONET (MSP-OC3), 16E1 (MSP-16E1T1) or 16T1 (MSP-16E1T1).       
      An E1/T1 signaling link interface on MSP-STM1 and MSP-OC3 can be used to connect the 
      MGW blade system to a Gateway Controller.

      and connects to the MXB blades systems via the IS backplane.

	For the DUA signaling protocol, you specify a Bitmap channel,

	For the DPNSS protocol there is one bitmap for the real channels and 
	another for the virtual channels. The bitmap for virtual channels is a 
	copy of the bitmap for real channels, so you can only specify one 
	bitmap. 
	For the DASS2 there is just one bitmap for the channels.

	The hexadecimal format is represented with an octet string. For each 
	octet the least significant bit corresponds to the lowest channel.
	octet #0 represents channels 0 to 7
	octet #1 represents channel 8 to 15
	octet #2 represents channel 16 to 23
	octet #3 represents channel 24 to 31

	For example, if channels 0 and 16 are not used, the octet string looks

	FFFEFFFE.

	The first bit being the most significant bit and the last being the 
	least significant bit.

	Octet #0 is represented as FF which equals the bits: 1111 1111. 
	Signaling interfaces will be created on all channels 24-31.

	Octet #1 is represented as FE which equals the bits: 1111 1110. 
	Signaling interfaces will be created on all channels except the channel
	that corresponds to the least significant bit, which is channel 16.

	Octet #2 is represented as FF which equals the bits: 1111 1111. 
	Signaling interfaces will be created on all channels 8-15.

	Octet #3 is represented as FE which equals the bits: 1111 1110.
