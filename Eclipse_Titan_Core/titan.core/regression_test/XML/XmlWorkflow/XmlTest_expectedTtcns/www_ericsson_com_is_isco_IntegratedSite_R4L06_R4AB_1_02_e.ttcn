/* The MO branch where the common Network resources are configured.

      configuration of various network properties of an
      Integrated Site. It contains the following configuration
      parts: */
/* * Blade system specific configuration - mapping blade
         system network requirements to common Integrated Site
         resources.  This activity must be performed before a
         new blade or blade system successfully can be unlocked
         via the Hardware service. Some blade systems
         have partly pre-registered network requirements,
         while others demand that you read the corresponding
         information from separate BS specific
         instructions and manually configure the blade system
         network requirements. The pre-registered network
         requirements automates parts of the blade
         system-specific configuration activity. The blade
         system specific configuration is specified in a
         separate class, BladeSystems/BladeSystem/BsNetworkConfiguration.

       * Common configuration - configuration of common
         Integrated Site resources, such as subnets, VLANs,
         traffic classes, and so on. Blade system network requirements
         are mapped to these common resources.

       * Publish configuration changes - publish updated
         configuration. In an Integrated Site, the blade
         systems obtain their actual network configuration
         dynamically in runtime. When you change the network
         configuration it will affect blade systems. In order to
         minimize the disturbance of active blade systems, the
         changes are normally applied in a separate storage,
         which is not visible to the blade systems. In order to
         make use of the new unpublished configuration, it must be
         explicitly published by altering the updateMode. If
         the new settings introduce severe problems, the
         configuration can be reverted to the old settings by
         altering the updateMode.

       * External Boot Server - configuration of External Boot Server

         instead fetch their boot files from a server outside the IS
         rack. */

/* nsed summary of the time zone

        val has a syntax like std offset or std offset dst
        [offset],start[/time],end[/time] where the first format
        is used when there is no Daylight Saving Time in the
        local time zone. The std string specifies the name of
        the time zone.  The offset specifies the time value you
        must add to the local time to get a Coordinated
        Universal Time value. For example, here is how we would
        specify Eastern Standard Time, but without any Daylight
        Saving Time alternative: "EST+5". The second format is
        used when there is Daylight Saving Time. The dst string
        and offset specify the name and offset for the
        corresponding Daylight Saving Time zone; if the offset
        is omitted, it defaults to one hour ahead of standard
        time.The remainder of the specification describes when
        Daylight Saving Time is in effect. The start field is
        when Daylight Saving Time goes into effect and the end
        field is when the change is made back to standard
        time. The following formats are recognized for these
        fields: Jn specifies the Julian day, with n between
        1 and 365. February 29 is never counted, even in leap
        years. n specifies the Julian day, with n between 0and
        365. February 29 is counted in leap years.  Mm.w.d
        specifies day d of week w of month m. The day d must be
        between 0 (Sunday) and 6.  The week must be between
        1 and 5; week 1 is the first week in which day d occurs,
        and week 5 specifies the last d day in the month. The
        month m should be between 1 and 12. The time fields
        specify when, in the local time currently in effect,
        the change to the other time occurs. If omitted, the
        default is 02:00:00.

        For example "EST+5EDT,M4.1.0/2,M10.5.0/2", specifies
        the Eastern time zone in the United States, including
