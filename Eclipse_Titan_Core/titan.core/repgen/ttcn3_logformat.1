.SH DESCRIPTION
This manual page is a quick reference for the TTCN-3 logformat utility of
the TTCN-3 Test Executor. The 
.B ttcn3_logformat
utility, which can be found in 
.I $TTCN3_DIR/bin,
reads the unformatted log file generated by test executor from its standard
input. It can split up the log into several files based on the lines that are
automatically logged at the beginning or end of each test case. Furthermore,
.B ttcn3_logformat
formats the sent and received messages in the log file. The structured values
are indented and each field is put into a new line according to the braces and
commas.
.SH OPTIONS
Available command line switches are:
.TP 10
.BI \-i " n"
Sets the depth of each indentation level to
.I n
characters. The default value is 4. If the sent or received PDU is too complex
and has too deeply nested fields, this number can be decreased to get more
readable output.
.TP
.BI \-o " outfile"
Places the output into file 
.IR "outfile" ". If the"
.I \-s 
flag is also set, only those parts of the log files will be written into this
file that were logged outside the test cases (i.e. in control part or on PTCs).
If this option is omitted, the formatted log will be printed to standard output.
.TP
.B \-s
If this option is set, the entries that were recorded during the execution of a 
particular test case will be saved in a separate file in
.I ttcn3_logformat
working directory. The name of this file will be identical to the name of the
test case. If the same test case is executed several times after each other, the
results of repeated test runs will be collected after each other. If the output
file contained some data before
.I ttcn3_logformat
was started (e.g. the results of previous test run), the output file will be
emptied and the old logs will be destroyed.
.br
.I ttcn3_logformat
recognizes any types of timestamps that can be set in the
.B [LOGGING]
section of the configuration file.
.sp 1
.B WARNING!
This option is useless when formatting the log files of PTCs, because these logs
do not contain the name of the testcase that the PTC belongs to.
.TP
.B \-n
If this option is set, newline and tab characters are not modified, they are
printed as \\n and \\t
.TP
.B \-v
Prints
.I version
and license key information and exits.
